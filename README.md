# Sorting Visualizer

A sorting visualizer app is a user interface that allows users to visualize the process of various sorting algorithms in action. The primary goal of this app is to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work by displaying the step-by-step process of rearranging elements in a list or array to achieve a sorted order.

## Key Features

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: The app supports multiple sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. Users can select and visualize the working of any specific algorithm.

2. **Input Controls**: Users can select the size of the list or array they want to sort, or they can provide their custom input. The app also has options to generate random data for sorting.

3. **Visualization**: The sorting process is visually represented in real-time. Elements in the list or array  move and swap positions as the sorting algorithm progresses. Visual cues, such as color changes or animations, are used to highlight comparisons and swaps.

4. **Speed Controls**: Users can adjust the speed of the visualization to see the sorting process in slow motion or at a faster pace.
